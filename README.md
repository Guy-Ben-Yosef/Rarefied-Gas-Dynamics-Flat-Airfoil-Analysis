The investigation into the hydrodynamic patterns around a flat airfoil in unsteady flow conditions delves into the complex realm of fluid mechanics, particularly focusing on the dynamics of fluid flow over thin airfoils or fins. This research area is pivotal for understanding the intricate behaviors of fluids interacting with solid bodies and has historically been a cornerstone of scientific exploration. Recent shifts in focus towards rarefied gas dynamics, which are prevalent at low pressures, high altitudes, or in micro-scale problems, underscore the evolving nature of fluid dynamics studies. The present study aims to further this exploration by analyzing unsteady rarefied gas dynamics over a flat airfoil using analytical methods, thereby contributing to a deeper understanding of fluid behavior in these specialized conditions.

The significance of this research extends into multiple facets of aerodynamics and fluid dynamics, offering insights that could enhance the design and efficiency of aerodynamic structures such as high-altitude aircraft and spacecraft. Moreover, the study's implications reach into the field of micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS), shedding light on the gas flow dynamics within micro-scale environments and potentially improving the functionality of microfluidic devices. By building upon previous research in both two-dimensional rarefied gas dynamics and numerical simulation techniques, this project not only enriches the existing knowledge base but also broadens the scope of investigation to include a variety of velocities and airfoil conditions. The anticipated outcomes promise advancements in computational modeling, simulation techniques, and the practical application of these findings in engineering and aerospace design.
